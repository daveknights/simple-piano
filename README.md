# simple-piano

RnD exercise, a simple piano made using [CreateJS](https://createjs.com/).
This basic app takes advantage of the separate libraries included with CreateJS.

- [PreloadS](https://createjs.com/preloadjs) is used to make sure the sound files are ready for use. The sounds are just a single octave of notes recorded as individual files in GarageBand.
- [EaselJS](https://createjs.com/easeljs) is used for drawing the keyboard.
- [TweenJS](https://createjs.com/tweenjs) is used for some small movement on the keys and animating the displayed note names.
- [SoundJS](https://createjs.com/soundjs) is used for playing the sound files.
