# simple-piano

RnD exercise, a simple piano made using https://createjs.com/.
This basic app takes advantage of the separate libraries included with CreateJS.

- https://createjs.com/preloadjs is used to make sure the sound files are ready for use. The sounds are just a single octave of notes recorded as individual files in GarageBand.
- https://createjs.com/easeljs is used for drawing the keyboard.
- https://createjs.com/tweenjs is used for some small movement on the keys and animating the displayed note names.
- https://createjs.com/soundjs is used for playing the sound files.
